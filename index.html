					<h3>What are Dashboards?</h3>
					
					<p>Dashboards tell us about critical business or operational metrics. Key features include:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>“Single pane of glass”</li>
						<li>Key performance indicators (KPIs) apparent</li>
						<li>Relevant KPIs are bunched together logically</li>
						<li>Layouts are consistent between dashboard elements and between related dashboards</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>“Dashboards are not an appropriate venue for artistic impression.” -- Stephen Few</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/dashboard.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Types of Dashboards</h3>
					
					<p>There are three major types of dashboards we will cover today:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Operational Dashboards</li>
						<li>Strategic Dashboards</li>
						<li>Tactical Dashboards</li>
					</ul>

					<p>These different dashboards fit the differing needs of an organization.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/lab.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Operational Dashboards</h3>
					
					<p>Operational dashboards provide “day-to-day” data that assist line employees in making decisions.  They tend to be specific to the nature of the user.</p>
					
					<img src="presentation/assets/image/1_OperationalDashboard.png" alt="Sample operational dashboard" />
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/rollercoaster.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Operational Dashboards</h3>
					
					<p>Operational dashboards <strong>drive action</strong> by informing that a process may be “out of control” and helping operators find the cause.</p>

				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Strategic Dashboards</h3>
					
					<p>Strategic dashboards focus on KPIs tracked periodically and displayed at an aggregated level.</p>

				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">

					<h3>The Key:  An Emotional Response</h3>
					
					<p>A great dashboard evokes one of two emotions from your intended audience:  happiness or anger.</p>
					
					<img src="presentation/assets/image/2_ProcessOutOfControl.png" alt="Examining a process which has gone out of control" height="320" />
					
					<p>If a dashboard evokes neither emotion in your intended audience, it isn't working.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/audience.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Know Your Audience</h3>
					
					<p>Key factors in knowing your audience:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Who is your intended audience?</li>
						<li>How will they use your dashboard?</li>
						<li>What actions do you want them to take as a result?</li>
						<li>Are you showing the right measures in the right way?</li>
						<li>What cultural differences might matter?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

						<li>C-levels?</li>
						<li>The board?</li>
						<li>External regulators or auditors?</li>
						<li>The general public?</li>

					<p>For each of these, we display different measures in different ways.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Intended Audience</h3>
					
					<p>This dashboard is great for a line worker, but a board member likely won't care about operational metrics.</p>

					<h3>Intended Use</h3>
					
					<p>How will users make use of your dashboard?  What actions do you want them to take as a result?</p>

					<p>Your job as a dashboard creator is to provide relevant metrics in an easy-to-understand way, requiring the user to get relevant information as easily as possible in order to make good business decisions.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/devices.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Intended Use</h3>
					
					<p>Critical considerations:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Do users need to see historical data or just the present value?</li>
						<li>Is there a baseline or known good value?</li>
						<li>Under what circumstances should a user act?  Can you display those rules?</li>
						<li>What media will your audience use to view the data?  Examples:  phone, tablet, desktop, TV.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/sales.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Right Measures, Right Way</h3>
					
					<p>Are you showing the right measures in the right way? For a sales team dashboard, you want to include sales-centric measures like leads in different steps of the pipeline, likelihood of a contact making a purchase, and number of sales by person against a quota.  You don't want to include measures like server uptime, net margin, or number of high-severity issues.</p>

					<h3>Cultural Differences</h3>
					
					<p>What cultural differences might matter?</p>

					<p>The meanings of colors can differ between cultures.  For example, in European and American culture, red typically has one of two major meanings:  love and danger.  In finance, we use red to indicate negative values (going back to danger).</p>

					<p>By contrast, in China, red has historically indicated prosperity--people give gifts of money at weddings and during major holidays in small red envelopes.</p>

					<h3>Visual Principles</h3>
					
					<p>In this section, we will look at six important visual principles:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Cognitive Load</li>
						<li>Less Is More</li>
						<li>Where The Eye Looks</li>
						<li>The Rule Of Thirds</li>
						<li>Glanceability</li>
						<li>Color Vision Deficiency</li>

				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/graywall.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.6">
					<h3>Cognitive Load</h3>
					
					<p>Our working memory can hold approximately 3-7 items at one time.  Think of this working memory like registers and our long-term memory like RAM:  we move information out of long-term memory into working memory and (sometimes) vice versa.</p>
					
					<img src="presentation/assets/image/7_Memory_consolidation.svg" alt="A representation of how human memory works" />
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/ram.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Cognitive Load</h3>
					
					<p>Because of this, we want to look for ways to reduce mental load.  Techniques include:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Allow people to group things together using attributes like size, shape, orientation, thickness, and color.</li>
						<li>Remove "noise" from the reader--get rid of things that distract or cause unnecessary load.</li>
						<li>Have your visuals tell a coherent story.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Less is More</h3>
					
					<p>Remove unnecessary clutter.</p>

				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Less is More</h3>

					<h3>3D Pains</h3>
					
					<p>Humans have trouble with precise 3D measurements.  In rare cases, a 3D image is better than a 2D equivalent, but that is never the case for bar or column charts.  3D "gloss" is also not helpful for getting your point across.</p>

						<li>Group metrics by function into sections:  don't make users search around for related data</li>

					<h3>Bar Versus Column Chart</h3>
					
					<p>Choose a bar chart if:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Category names are lengthy</li>
						<li>You have a <strong>lot</strong> of categories</li>
						<li>You have relatively few periods (ideally, 1)</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Choose a column chart if:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Viewing across periods is important</li>
						<li>You have many periods with relatively few categories</li>
						<li>Category names are short</li>

					<h3>Bar and Column Charts</h3>
					
					<p>Bar and column charts should start at the origin (0).</p>

					<h3>Cleveland Dot Plots</h3>
					
					<p>Named after Bill Cleveland, this is a minimalistic visual for comparing categories.</p>
					
					<img src="presentation/assets/image/11_DotPlot.png" alt="An example of a Cleveland dot plot" />
					
					<p>Dot plots are not native to Power BI, but there are a couple of custom visuals which give you dot plots.  They can provide a lot of information in a very small amount of space, making them great accompaniments for tables or larger visuals.</p>

					<h3>Line Charts</h3>
					
					<p>Great for time series data stretching over many periods with non-cyclical data, but showing few categories.  You can also use a column chart here, especially with only 2-3 categories</p>

					<h3>Line and Column Charts</h3>
					
					<p>Risky chart, but works well with two inter-related but distinct variables. Often used with stock market levels and volumes.</p>

					<h3>Line Charts:  From The Origin?</h3>
					
					<p>For bar charts, we want to start at the origin.  For line charts (and dot plots), we don't need to.  Instead, Cleveland, McGill, &amp; McGill proposed making the average line slope 45 degrees.  This principle reduces the potential for confusion when viewing a line chart and is why it's fine to have the bottom of a line chart start above 0.</p>

					<p>Power BI and Excel (as well as many data visualization tools) automatically do this for you.</p>
